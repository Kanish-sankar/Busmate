**Q: How do we manage routes?**
A: Web dashboard for school admin. Add/edit routes, stops, assign students, manage drivers - all from one interface.

**Q: Implementation time?**
A: 3-5 days for setup. We import your existing data, configure routes, and train staff.

**Q: Cost?**
A: Based on fleet size. For 25 buses: ₹XXX/month (all-inclusive: app, tracking, support, hosting)
